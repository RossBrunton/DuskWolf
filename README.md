# DuskWolf #
The DuskWolf engine is basically a game engine thing; it has modules and stuff which can help you make your games! It also has a GUI system, so that too!

It is mainly designed for making games, specifically RPGs and platformers, but I suppose you could hack it to work to any other use if you wanted to...

You can see an example of it running at [http://www.savagewolf.org/games/duskWolf].
